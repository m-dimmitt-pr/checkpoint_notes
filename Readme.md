## The purpose of this repository:
Research for an application called checkpoint.

The idea being users generate all the code at runtime and then when they type checkpoint. 
<br/>the code is converted from runtime to compiled time.

In this way everything is passed in as user input and then evaluated.
<br/>In the future a ui could be generating this code. 
<br/>Additionally in the future the runtime could rebuild every time. as a less efficient example that builds everything the slow way.
